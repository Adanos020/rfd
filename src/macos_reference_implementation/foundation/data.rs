//! A wrapper for `NSData`.

//! This more or less exists to try and wrap the specific APIs we use to interface with Cocoa. Note
//! that in general this is only concerned with bridging for arguments - i.e, we need an `NSData`

//! happens solely on the Rust side of things before coming through here.
//!
//! tl;dr this is an intentionally limited API.
