Rusty file dialogs for Windows, Linux (GTK), MacOS And WASM32.

# Why RFD?

- It uses 100% native API on all platforms, it does not spawn any processes in the background.
- It supports async/await syntax
- And if one day you decide to port your program to browser, WASM support is there for you!

# Dependencies
#### On Linux:
###### For GTK version:
- GTK3 development libraries (on debian `libgtk-3-dev` on arch `gtk3`)
###### For XFG Portal version (in case you out-out of GTK version):
- XDG Portal provider of you choice has to be present on the system. (Most distros have one by default) 

# Features
- `parent` Adds a dialog parenting support via `raw-window-handle`
- `gtk3` Uses GTK for dialogs, if you know for sure that your users have XDG Portal around you can safely disable this, and drop C dependency 

# Example

```rust
// Sync Dialog
let files = FileDialog::new()
    .add_filter("text", &["txt", "rs"])
    .add_filter("rust", &["rs", "toml"])
    .set_directory("/")
    .pick_file();

// Async Dialog
let file = AsyncFileDialog::new()
    .add_filter("text", &["txt", "rs"])
    .add_filter("rust", &["rs", "toml"])
    .set_directory("/")
    .pick_file()
    .await;

let data = file.read().await;
```

### Difference between `MacOS Windowed App` and `MacOS NonWindowed App`

- Macos async dialog requires a started `NSApplication` instance, so dialog is truly async only when opened in windowed env like `winit`,`SDL2`, etc. otherwise it will fallback to sync dialog.
- It is also recommended to spawn dialogs on main thread, RFD can run dialogs from any thread but it is only possible in windowed app and it adds a little bit of overhead. So it is recommended to: [spawn on main and await in other thread](https://github.com/PolyMeilex/rfd/blob/master/examples/async.rs)
- NonWindowed apps will never be able to spawn dialogs from threads diferent than main
- NonWindowed apps will never be able to spawn async dialogs
